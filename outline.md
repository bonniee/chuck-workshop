10:30am - 12:20pm

1 hour and 50 minutes = 110 minutes

10 minutes: what is musical programming? why do it? difference between the _programming_ bits and the _sound synthesis_

10 minutes: intro to ChucK environment / IDE / command line interface, and basic hello world with parameter

10:30am-11:00am: me lecturing about ChucK

-- break! -- at 12:00pm for demos

Sound synthesis is SUPER COOL!
Here's a sine wave. Here's what pitch/frequency and volume/amplitude do.

Here's another kind of wave. Here's what that sounds like.


2min per slide on sound synthesis.


Hey everyone!

Structure: I'm going to talk to you for about half an hour about computer music, and musical programming, and we're going to walk through some examples of programmatic sound synthesis together. After that, I've put together a workbook for you all, and we're going to spend an hour coding. If you already know basic sound synthesis, you should feel totally comfortable skipping to the workbook.

Now, during the coding portion, I'm going to ask you all to write your own compositions and show them off, so as we're walking through this, keep some ideas churning in the back of your mind.
